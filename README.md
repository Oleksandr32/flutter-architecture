# flutter_architecture

A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for choosing Flutter architecture for the project.
I will consider three architectures:
- Vanilla
- Scoped Model
- BLoC

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.io/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our 
[online documentation](https://flutter.io/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
